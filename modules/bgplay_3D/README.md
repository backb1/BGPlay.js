GraphView 3D
============

This module implements a 3D graph visualization for BGPlay. 
It has been developed by Lorenzo Antonetti and Roberto Sepe during their Master's degree thesis,
led by Prof. Maurizio Patrignani (Roma Tre University, Italy).

It is based on the version SVN9660 of BGPlay.js but it is not yet compatible with newer versions.
